Different positions on Original Sin
===================================

Compiled by Richard Jackson

Pelagianism
-----------

Pelagianism derives its name from Pelagius who lived in the 5th century
A.D. and was a teacher in Rome, though he was British by birth. It is a
heresy dealing with the nature of man. Pelagius, whose family name was
Morgan, taught that people had the ability to fulfill the commands
of [God](https://carm.org/dictionary-god) by exercising the freedom of
human will apart from the [grace](https://carm.org/dictionary-grace) of
God. In other words, a person's free will is totally capable of choosing
God and/or to do good or bad without the aid of Divine intervention.
Pelagianism teaches that man's nature is basically good. Thus it denies
original sin,
the [doctrine](https://carm.org/dictionary-doctrine) that
we have inherited a sinful nature from Adam. He said that Adam only hurt
himself when he fell, and all of his descendants were not affected by
Adam's sin. Pelagius taught that a person is born with the same purity
and moral abilities as Adam was when he was first made by God. He taught
that people can choose God by the exercise of their free will and
rational thought. God's grace, then, is merely an aid to help
individuals come to Him.

Pelagianism fails to understand man's nature and weakness. We are by
nature sinners ([Eph.
2:3](http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Eph.%202.3); [Psalm
51:5](http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps%2051.5)). We all have sinned
because sin entered the world through Adam: "Therefore, just as sin
entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this
way death came to all men, because all sinned" ([Rom. 5:12,
NIV](http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Rom.%205.12)). Furthermore, [Romans
3:10-12](http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom%203.10-12) says, "There is
none righteous, not even one; 11 There is none who understands, There is
none who seeks for God; 12 All have turned aside, together they have
become useless; There is none who does good, There is not even one."
Therefore, we are unable to do God's will ([Rom.
6:16](http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom.%206.16); [7:14](http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom%207.14)).
We were affected by the fall of Adam---contrary to what Pelagius taught.

Classical Arminianism
---------------------

"In this \[fallen\] state, the free will of man towards the true good is
not only wounded, infirm, bent, and weakened; but it is also imprisoned,
destroyed, and lost. And its powers are not only debilitated and useless
unless they be assisted by grace, but it has no powers whatever except
such as are excited by Divine grace."

(Source) Arminius, James The Writings of James Arminius (three vols.)

Wesleyan Arminianism
--------------------

We were not made guilty by Adam's sin. We inherited a tendency to fall
into sin, and we inevitably do fall into sin, but we did not participate
in the original sin of Adam. Romans 5:14 teaches that Adam's descendants
did not sin in the same manner as Adam himself did. If we did not sin
with Adam, we are not guilty of that sin. Ezekiel 18:20 teaches that the
son shall not bear the sin of the father. We certainty are suffering the
consequences of Adam's sin because we are biologically connected to him,
but we cannot be justly condemned to hell simply because of inherited
depravity.

The two basic kinds of sin are inherited depravity, which is the
corruption of our nature that inclines us toward sinning, and acts of
sin.

Calvinism
---------

Sin has affected all parts of man. The heart, emotions, will, mind, and
body are all affected by sin. We are completely sinful. We are not as
sinful as we could be, but we are completely affected by sin.

The doctrine of Total Depravity is derived from scriptures that reveal
human character: Man’s heart is evil (Mark 7:21-23) and sick Jer. 17:9).
Man is a slave of sin (Rom. 6:20). He does not seek for God (Rom.
3:10-12). He cannot understand spiritual things (1 Cor. 2:14). He is at
enmity with God (Eph. 2:15). And, is by nature a child of wrath (Eph.
2:3). The Calvinist asks the question, "In light of the scriptures that
declare man’s true nature as being utterly lost and incapable, how is it
possible for anyone to choose or desire God?" The answer is, "He cannot.
Therefore God must predestine."

Calvinism also maintains that because of our fallen nature we are born
again not by our own will but God’s will (John 1:12-13); God grants that
we believe (Phil. 1:29); faith is the work of God (John 6:28-29); God
appoints people to believe (Acts 13:48); and God predestines (Eph.
1:1-11; Rom. 8:29; 9:9-23).

### [Sin, Original](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=S&word=SIN.ORIGINAL)

(inherited; hereditary; principal; capital; Adam's sin; nature-sin;
person-sin).

1. In its ordinary meaning this term does not refer to the origin of sin but to
   the guilt of Adam's sin imputed to his offspring (hereditary guilt, Ro
   5:12–19; Eph
   2:3; [*cf.*](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.CF) [*FC*](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.FC) [*SD*](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.SD) I
   9) and the corruption of man's nature that occurred when sin entered and
   which inheres in the human will and
   inclinations.[*Cf.*](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.CF) Gn
   5:3; 6:5; 8:21; Jb 15:14; Ps 51:5; Jn 3:6; Ro 14:23. Original sin is not an
   activity but a quality, a state, an inherent condition. It exists, though
   there be no conscious, voluntary act of internal or external powers, of mind
   or body.  It is “the chief sin, a root and fountainhead of all actual sins”
   ([*FC*](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.FC) [*SD*](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.SD) I

Southern Baptist Convention
---------------------------

Man is the special creation of God, made in His own image. He created
them male and female as the crowning work of His creation. The gift of
gender is thus part of the goodness of God's creation. In the beginning
man was innocent of sin and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of
choice. By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into
the human race. Through the temptation of Satan man transgressed the
command of God, and fell from his original innocence whereby his
posterity inherit a nature and an environment inclined toward sin.
Therefore, as soon as they are capable of moral action, they become
transgressors and are under condemnation. Only the grace of God can
bring man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill the
creative purpose of God. The sacredness of human personality is evident
in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for
man; therefore, every person of every race possesses full dignity and is
worthy of respect and Christian love.

Methodist View
--------------

Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do
vainly talk), but it is the corruption of the nature of every man, that
naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very
far gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to
evil, and that continually.

The condition of man after the [fall of
Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Man) is such that he cannot
turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and works, to
faith, and calling upon God; wherefore we have no power to do good
works, pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by
Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us,
when we have that good will.

Seventh Day Adventists
----------------------

The clearest expression of the hereditary nature of our innate
sinfulness is found in Ps 51:5, "Behold I was shapen in iniquity; and in
sin did my mother conceive me." The Seventh-day Adventist Bible
Commentary observes concerning this text: David recognised that children
inherit natures with propensities to evil (see Job 14:4; Ps 58:3; PP
61,306; MH 372,373; GC 533). He did not seek to excuse his sin, but
sought to stress the still greater need of God’s mercy because of his
inborn tendency to do evil (see PP 64).95 …

Self-centredness was the issue in the fall of Satan, "I will ascend
above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high." (Isa
14:14). It is also the heart of the original sin problem. Through the
fall, Ellen White says:

> Satan conformed to his own nature the father and
> mother of our race. Is it any wonder that we are born as selfcentred
> rebels? As any parent knows, children are by nature egotistic,
> everything belongs to them and revolves around them; children have to
> learn to share, to be altruistic in their actions. As Heppenstall points
> out: Original sin is not per se wrong doing, but wrong being. So there
> is a causal connection between the first sin of the first man and the
> self-centredness of his posterity. The consequence of Adam's sin was
> total. Accordingly, original sin is a state of the whole self in
> relation to God. It is never simply a physiological or biological
> problem. Trying to locate sin or the transmission of sin genetically
> simply misses the real problem. The issue is a spiritual one and not
> something in a gene. Sin is not transmitted genetically from parents to
> children. Sin must not be reduced to something physical.

The last part of this quote makes an important point. SIN is a spiritual
problem not a physical defect, though our physical degeneration is
certainly one result of Adam’s sin. But "bad habits and practices are
developed, they do not come via the genes." Whatever inherited
character defects we may have, like death they are the result of the
fall -- the outgrowth of our separation from God. Our sinful nature is
located primarily in our mind not in our bloodstream. Thus Ellen White
says: "In order to understand this matter aright, we must remember that
our hearts \[minds\] are naturally depraved, and we are unable of
ourselves to pursue a right course."
