Crucifixion and resurrection
============================

Below is a list of versus on the crucifixion and resurrection compiled by
Jonathan Gross for the Lunchbox Theology meeting on April 4, 2018.

* Leviticus 16:20--22 (bearing of sin in Day of Atonement ritual)
* Isaiah 53 (the suffering servant bearing sin and healing, among other things)
* Hebrews 2:5--18 (Jesus was perfected through suffering, destroyed the devil
  through death, and shared in our humanity in order to be our high priest)
* Hebrews 10:1--14 (Jesus accomplishes in his offering what the sacrifices
  prescribed by the law were unable to accomplish)
