Reason for belief
=================

Below are some notes from our Lunchbox Theology meeting on April 18, 2018. The
discussion built off a question from the previous meeting about the difference
between saying Christianity is "true because it works" or "works because it's
true". These notes were compiled by Jonathan Gross.

* True because it works
  * Seems to be the perspective from which Jordan Peterson is coming
  * Has some scriptural support in John 7:17
* Works because it's true
  * Sounds like the spirit in which Paul says our faith is useful only because
    Christ truly rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1--19)
* This question touches on the distinction between general and special
  revelation
* It's important to think critically about why we believe certain things, since
  we can say or even convince ourselves that it is for one reason when upon
  inspection it's actually for another (*e.g.*, when asked about why certain
  books are excluded from the canon, it is not uncommon to hear
  someone say they reject the noncanonical book on the grounds that it does not
  harmonize with other scripture---which is a reason grounded in personal
  inspection---when in fact the individual has never read the book in
  question---exposing a reason grounded in an outside authority)
