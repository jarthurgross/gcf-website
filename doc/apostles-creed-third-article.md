Luther’s Small Catechism

*What does this mean?*

I believe that by my own reason or strength I cannot believe in Jesus
Christ, my Lord, or come to him. But the Holy Spirit has called me
through the Gospel, enlightened me with his gifts, and sanctified and
preserved me in true faith, just as he calls, gathers, enlightens and
sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth and preserves it in union
with Jesus Christ in the one true faith. In this Christian church he
daily and abundantly forgives all my sins, and the sins of all
believers, and on the last day he will raise me and all the dead and
will grant eternal life to me and to all who believe in Christ. This is
most certainly true.

Holy Spirit ([LCMS Christian Cyclopedia](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=H&word=HOLYSPIRIT))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Holy Spirit (Spirit of God; Spirit of Christ; Spirit; Holy Ghost) is
identified with God (*Ps 139:7–8*; *Acts 5:3–4*; *Ro 8:9*; *1 Co 3:16*;
*2 Co 3:17*). In part He is described as a person distinct from Father
and Son and proceeding from them (*Mt 28:19*; *Jn 14:26*; *15:26*; *Gl
4:6*). Also called Paraclete on basis of the
[**Gk.**](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.GK),
[**e.g.**](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.EG), in *Jn
14:16*; *16:7*.

The work of creation, ascribed to the Father
([**e.g.**](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.EG), *1 Co
8:6*) and to the Son
([**e.g.**](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.EG), *Jn
1:3*), is also ascribed to the Holy Spirit
([**e.g.**](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.EG), *Jb
33:4*); sanctification, ascribed to the Holy Spirit
([**e.g.**](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.EG), *Ro
8:14*; *Gl 5:17–25*), is also ascribed to the Father and the Son
([**e.g.**](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/abbrev.asp?abbrev=ABBR.EG), *Eph
3:14–19*). Acts assigned specifically to the Spirit: revealing of the
truth and grace of God to man (*1 Co 2:10–11*); converting man and
putting new life and spirit into him (*Jn 3:5*; *1 Co 12:3*); preserving
saving faith (*1 Jn 4:13*); enabling the believer to resist the flesh
and produce fruits of faith in love (*Gl 5:16–18*, *22–25*; *Eph
4:22–24*; *1 Ptr 1:22*).

In one sense the Holy Spirit is wholly beyond reach of man; man makes no
contribution to Him or to his grasp of Him (*Jn 3:8*). But the Christian
has received the Holy Spirit and His power through Baptism (*Titus 3:5*)
and can continually reinforce His presence through the Word of the
Gospel (*1 Ptr 1:22–25*). Man is equipped with the Holy Spirit to
communicate the grace of God in Christ Jesus, the forgiveness of sins,
and the life of the Spirit to others (*Mt. 28:19–20*; *Lk 24:45–49*; *Jn
20:21–23*).

Southern Baptist Convention ([SBC Website](http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfm2000.asp))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. He inspired holy men of old to
write the Scriptures. Through illumination He enables men to understand
truth. He exalts Christ. He convicts of sin, of righteousness, and of
judgment. He calls men to the Saviour, and effects regeneration. He
cultivates Christian character, comforts believers, and bestows the
spiritual gifts by which they service God through His church. He seals
the believer unto the day of final redemption. His presence in the
Christian is the assurance of God to bring the believer into the
fullness of the stature of Christ. He enlightens and empowers the
believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.

Pentacostal Church of God ([PCG Website](http://www.pcg.org/beliefs))
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*6. The Ministry* God, through the Holy Spirit, definitely calls
such as He desires to serve as apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors
and teachers, and specifically endues the one called with the talents
and gifts peculiar to that office or offices (Ephesians 4:11, 12). Under
no circumstances should anyone be ordained or set apart to any such
office unless the calling is distinct and evident.

*8. The Baptism of the Holy Ghost* The Baptism of the Holy Ghost and
fire (Matthew 3:11), is a gift from God, as promised by the Lord Jesus
Christ to all believers in this dispensation of time, and is received
subsequent to the new birth (John 14:16, 17; Acts 1:8; 2:38, 39;
10:44--48). The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is accompanied by speaking in
other tongues as the Holy Spirit Himself gives utterance as the initial
physical sign and evidence (Acts 2:4).

**742** "Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our
hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!"' (*Gal* 4:6).  **743** From the beginning to
the end of time, whenever God sends his Son, he always sends his Spirit: their
mission is conjoined and inseparable. **744** In the fullness of time the Holy
Spirit completes in Mary all the preparations for Christ's coming among the
People of God. By the action of the Holy Spirit in her, the Father gives the
world Emmanuel "God-with-us" (*Mt* 1:23). **745** The Son of God was
consecrated as Christ (Messiah) by the anointing of the Holy Spirit at his
Incarnation (cf. *Ps* 2:6--7).  **746** By his Death and his Resurrection, Jesus
is constituted in glory as Lord and Christ (cf. *Acts* 2:36). From his
fullness, he poured out the Holy Spirit on the apostles and the Church.
**747** The Holy Spirit, whom Christ the head pours out on his members, builds,
animates, and sanctifies the Church. She is the sacrament of the Holy Trinity's
communion with men.
